# Ulauncher Extension doesnÂ´t install and now

> Source for the website [ulauncher-extension-doesnt-install-and-now](https://ulauncher-extension-doesnt-install-and-now.netlify.app)

## Motivation

After being constantly asked the same question over and over again, dozens of issues open in extensions repositories, I thought it might be easier to just reference someone to a website than to write the same answer everytime.

## Development

```sh
yarn dev
```
